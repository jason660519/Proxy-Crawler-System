FAQs

Frequently asked questions about our proxy list

### [How can I get the proxy list?](#collapse13)

You can get the proxy list by our free [APP or API](#get). Our system will send the password immediately after your purchase.

### [Is there an API document?](#collapse11)

Yes, you can view the [API tutorial](https://free-proxy-list.net/blog/get-proxy-list-using-api) here.

### [Those proxies support Google, Instagram, Craigslist?](#collapse14)

No. Those proxies are public proxies which we collect from the Internet. They don't support those websites. For Google, Instagram, or Craigslist, you can buy our [premium proxies](rotating-proxy.html).

### [Are your proxies residential?](#collapse15)

No. Our proxies are public proxies from datacenters. You can buy rotating residential proxies from [this vendor](http://hide-my-ip.net/smart).

### [How do you update the proxy lists?](#collapse2)

We update the proxy lists every 30 minutes. On update, we add new working proxies to the lists and remove dead proxies from them. The working proxies remain on the lists.

### [Why are your proxies unstable and slow?](#collapse3)

Our proxies are [public](https://free-proxy-list.net/blog/public-proxy-private-proxy) [HTTP proxy](https://free-proxy-list.net/blog/socks-proxy-http-proxy) which we collect from the internet. They are unstable and usually slow but very cheap, considering a private proxy charges $1+/month. Our proxies are suitable for users who need a lot of IP addresses and use each one for only a while, especially SEO/traffic tools (ex. scrapers and bots).

For stable, fast, and anonymous surfing, please try our new product: [My IP Hide](https://myiphide.com/)

### [What is the proxy anonymity?](#collapse4)

There are 3 levels of proxies according to their anonymity.

* Level 1 - Elite Proxy / Highly Anonymous Proxy: The websites can't detect you are using a proxy.
* Level 2 - Anonymous Proxy: The websites know you are using a proxy but can't know your real IP.
* Level 3 - Transparent Proxy: The websites know you are using a proxy as well as your real IP.

### [What is a HTTPS/SSL proxy?](#collapse5)

The URL of the secure websites starts with https:// instead of http:// (ex. https://www.paypal.com). The proxies which support those HTTPS sites are HTTPS (SSL) proxies. HTTPS proxies support HTTP websites too. [Elite Proxy Switcher](https://www.eliteproxyswitcher.com/) can test whether a proxy supports HTTPS sites.

### [Must I buy your software to get the proxies?](#collapse6)

No. You can use the free version of our [proxy software](https://www.eliteproxyswitcher.com/) to download the proxy list. You can also use the [API URL](https://free-proxy-list.net/blog/get-proxy-list-using-api) to get it.

### [Can I buy proxies in the US or Europe only?](#collapse7)

No. We don't have packages for specific countries. However, you can filter the proxy list by country using our [APP or API](#get).

### [Are the proxies exclusive to me?](#collapse9)

No. They are not exclusive. We provide the same proxies to other users.

### [Can I get completely different proxies every day?](#collapse10)

No. The working proxies remain on our proxy lists. You will get some same proxies every time.

### [Can I get more proxies if I buy two lists?](#collapse8)

No, you will get the same proxies.

### [What is a subnet?](#collapse21)

The IPs in A.B.C.0 ~ A.B.C.255 (ex. 11.22.33.0 ~ 11.22.33.255) are in the same subnet.

It's easy for websites to trace or block IPs from the same subnet.

Other vendors usually sell 10K proxies in 50 subnets. Our subnets are [much more](#country).
