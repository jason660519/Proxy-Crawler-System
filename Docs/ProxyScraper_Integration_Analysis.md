## ProxyScraper Integration Analysis and Recommendations

### Scope
Concise assessment of integrating external ProxyScraper sources with the current Proxy Crawler & Manager system.

### Architecture Fit
- Ingestion: source adapters fetch raw lists; normalize to `ProxyNode`.
- Validation: async connectivity/speed/anonymity/geo checks; scoring.
- Storage: Postgres `proxy_nodes` (Alembic-managed); hot proxies cached in Redis.
- Exposure: `/api/proxy`, `/api/proxies`, filtering/export endpoints.
- Observability: Prometheus counters/latency; Grafana dashboard.

### Integration Strategy
- Source adapters: small per-source modules for HTTP/SOCKS lists (txt/json/csv).
- Quality gates: score thresholds, response time caps, anonymity and geo filters before insert.
- Scheduling: periodic refresh with jitter; backoff and retries for flaky sources.
- Deduplication: unique (host, port, protocol); atomic updates of `last_checked`, `score`.

### Recommendations
- Start with 3–5 reliable sources and measure success rate; expand gradually.
- Add metrics for added/updated/invalid proxies; validation latency and success rates.
- Maintain backup legacy crawlers to mitigate upstream outages.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Source volatility → cache + exponential backoff.
- Data drift → sanitize/validate schema (protocols, countries).
- Performance → batch operations; async validation; pool hot results in Redis.

### Rollout Plan
- Phase 1: 1–2 sources, validate pipeline and metrics.
- Phase 2: expand sources, tune scoring and filters.
- Phase 3: automated pruning, trends, and alerts on degradation.
