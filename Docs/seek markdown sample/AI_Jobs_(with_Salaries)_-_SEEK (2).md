## Description

Your first job doesn’t have to mean coffee runs and spreadsheets. Here, you’ll be building things that actually matter.

Forget theory-land. Forget waiting years to make an impact. Here, you’ll be the grad who gets handed a real problem and asked: **“What can you build?”**

-   And then ... you’ll build it.
    
    -   Get a Minimum Viable Product working.
        
        -   Refine it.
            
            -   Tighten it.
                
                -   Polish it until people say: *“Wait… this was manual before?”*
                    

We’re after someone who loves the craft — the kind of person who sees a target and won’t stop until the workflow they’ve built doesn’t just deliver results… it soars.

First Focus is Australia’s premier mid-market managed service provider, rapidly expanding with over 300 staff across Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Africa, and Ireland. We’re proud of our dynamic culture, clear vision, and strong leadership that champions innovation and growth. Now, we’re looking for people who are as excited about the future of our industry as we are.

## 🕹 What You’ll Actually Do

-   Turn business challenges into **AI-powered workflows** that make life easier for real teams
    
-   Build MVP solutions, then **iterate them into tools, flows and automations that feel almost effortless**
    
-   Connect APIs and platforms in smart ways so systems work seamlessly together
    
-   Work with teammates and clients to translate messy needs into clean, working automations
    
-   Keep improving your workflows until they don’t just run — they **fly**
    

## Requirements

## 🎒 What You Bring (no superhero cape required)

-   Some **Python** under your belt, plus comfort with AI/automation libraries and APIs
    
-   Familiarity with workflow tools (Power Automate, Zapier, n8n, Airtable — whatever gets you results)
    
-   Confidence jumping into cloud basics (AWS, Azure or GCP)
    
-   A builder’s streak: you like to see things made, working, and delivering value.
    
-   Experience with TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face is a plus (but not essential)
    
-   Bonus points if you’ve ever proudly said “I built that.”
    
-   Finally, values that resonate with ours ... you can check them out on the "About Us" page at FirstFocus dot com dot au.
    

## Benefits

## 🌍 Why This Role Rocks

-   Real businesses, real problems, **real results** — from day one.
    
-   Freedom to build like it’s your own startup project — with clear goals and ownership.
    
-   Free access to Uprise, including 1:1 coaching with qualified psychologists or counselors.
    
-   Flexible hybrid working arrangements to ensure work-life balance.
    
-   Continuous personal and professional development with paid study days, certifications, and leadership training.
    
-   An engaging and inclusive culture with regular social events.
    
-   Profit share as a loyalty incentive for long-term commitment.
    
-   While your peers are still in grad rotations, you’ll be pointing to the systems you built that made a difference
    

If you love turning targets into working solutions, this is where you’ll thrive.

Applications from neurodiverse candidates are welcome—we provide flexible options to best showcase your skills.

👉 Ready to build stuff that doesn't simply work—but does the work? We'd love to talk!

PS. In case you wondered, yes we used AI to help us write this ad, we will use AI to help us filter your CV from the pack, and will use automations to smooth the recruitment process, because we really love this stuff too!
